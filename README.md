## What if I miss Seminar? 

If you miss a seminar you can make up the session in one of 3 different ways. 

1.	If the seminar involves a reading you can write a 500 word summary and reflection about the reading. The document should include a 250 word summary of the readings and a 250 word reflection about the readings. These should be emailed to the course instructor. 
2.	If the seminar does not involve a reading you can read a journal article of your choice and write a 500 summary and reflection. The document should include a 250 word summary of the readings and a 250 word reflection about the readings. These should be emailed to the course instructor. 
3.	You can attend a guest lecture, workshop, or conference that happens outside of the regular seminar time. You can find information about public lectures here (https://gazette.mun.ca/events/). This can be anything related to your thesis or other type of prefessional development. You can fill in the information (title, location, date, time)  on the “additional seminar form” and have the presenter or organizer sign the form. 

__Note.__ Despite having all of these methods to make up seminar attendance, it is expected that students attend the seminar in person as much as possible.
